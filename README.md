# GANsDTA
## 💡 Description
Drug-Target binding affinity prediction using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is an innovative approach in computational drug discovery. GANs are a class of artificial intelligence models that consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which work together in a game-like manner. In this context, the generator generates potential drug molecules, while the discriminator assesses their binding affinity to specific target proteins. The GANs are trained on known drug-target interaction data, enabling them to learn and generate new drug-like molecules that have a higher probability of binding strongly to the target. By leveraging GANs for this prediction task, researchers aim to accelerate the drug development process by identifying potential drug candidates with enhanced binding affinity, ultimately improving the chances of success in drug discovery and optimization.

# 🔍 Datasets:
### Dataset Source:
The data files were downloaded from xyz.com  
### Description:
The Davis dataset is a comprehensive collection of molecular interactions, consisting of 68 distinct drugs and 442 target proteins. The dataset includes pairwise affinities, which are quantified using Kd values, representing the kinase dissociation constant. These Kd affinity values offer insights into the binding abilities of drugs to their corresponding target proteins. However, the range of affinities spans a wide spectrum, from as low as 0.016 to as high as 10000. Due to the considerable variation in affinities, it can sometimes impact the accuracy of predictive models. To mitigate this issue and enhance the performance of our experiments, we transform the Kd values into logspace, resulting in pKd values. This logarithmic transformation compresses the range of affinities, making them more manageable and conducive to accurate predictions in our drug discovery research. The utilization of pKd values allows us to better understand and model drug-target interactions, ultimately facilitating the development of novel and effective therapeutics.  
### Preprocessing:
During the preprocessing stage, the raw dataset is cleaned and formatted to ensure consistency and remove any irrelevant information. Additionally, data normalization is performed to bring features to a similar scale, enabling more effective model training and analysis.

## 🧠 Model Architecture
The GAN architecture for drug discovery generally consists of the following key components:

1. 🧪 **Generator**: The generator network takes random noise or latent vectors as input and transforms them into molecular structures. It usually comprises several layers of neural units that progressively upsample the input to generate complex molecular representations.

2. 🔍 **Discriminator**: The discriminator network, also known as the critic, receives molecular structures as input and tries to distinguish between real molecules from the training dataset and fake molecules produced by the generator. Like the generator, it also consists of several layers, but it progressively downsamples the input to make binary predictions (real or fake).

3. 🌌 **Latent Space**: The latent space is the representation of the random noise fed into the generator. It is a low-dimensional vector space where the generator learns to map the noise into meaningful molecular structures. The dimensionality of the latent space significantly influences the diversity and quality of the generated molecules.

4. 🔍 **Loss Functions**: GANs are trained using two main loss functions. The generator aims to minimize the discriminator's ability to distinguish between real and fake molecules, which is achieved by maximizing the discriminator's loss on generated samples. Simultaneously, the discriminator aims to maximize its ability to differentiate real from fake samples.

5. 🔄 **Training Process**: During training, the generator and the discriminator are updated in an adversarial manner. The generator generates fake molecules and tries to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator learns to become more accurate in distinguishing real molecules from fake ones. This iterative process continues until both networks converge to a point where the generator produces realistic molecular structures and the discriminator struggles to differentiate them from real ones.

6. 🎯 **Output**: The final output of the GAN is the generator itself, which can be used to generate novel drug-like molecules with desired properties. These generated molecules can be further filtered based on specific criteria or used in virtual screening to identify potential drug candidates for experimental validation.
