Drug-Target binding affinity prediction using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is an innovative approach in computational drug discovery. GANs are a class of artificial intelligence models that consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which work together in a game-like manner. In this context, the generator generates potential drug molecules, while the discriminator assesses their binding affinity to specific target proteins. The GANs are trained on known drug-target interaction data, enabling them to learn and generate new drug-like molecules that have a higher probability of binding strongly to the target. By leveraging GANs for this prediction task, researchers aim to accelerate the drug development process by identifying potential drug candidates with enhanced binding affinity, ultimately improving the chances of success in drug discovery and optimization.
